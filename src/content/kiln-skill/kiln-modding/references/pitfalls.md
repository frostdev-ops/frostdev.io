# Common mistakes

| Mistake | What happens | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Calling a service from `Task.Run`, a timer or a socket callback | `InvalidOperationException` ("wrong thread") or a race with the game's jobs | `Context.Scheduler.Post(...)` or `await Context.Scheduler.NextTick()` first |
| `.Result` / `.Wait()` / `Thread.Sleep` on the tick thread | the server's step stalls; a blocked test cannot time out | `await` (continuations come back to the tick thread) |
| Changing content in `OnLoad` directly | the registries may not be ready, and the change is not applied again at the next world load or pack reload | `Content.OnReady(_ => ...)`; register new items in `OnLoad` |
| Setting the time of day or touching world state in `OnLoad` | the save load overwrites it; on a client there may be no world yet | do it in `ServerStartedEvent` (or `Client.Tick` on a client) |
| A new GUID on every build, or changing a released GUID | saved items disappear or become `[Missing: …]` placeholders | generate GUIDs once and hard-code them |
| Shipping `Kiln.Api.dll` or `Kiln.<Service>.dll` in the mod folder | type identity breaks; the mod may not load | let Kiln.Sdk reference them (`ExcludeAssets=runtime`) |
| Guessing field paths or item names | the pack logs "unknown field" / "selector matched nothing" and does nothing | `kiln catalog search`, or `Content.Dump()` (`kiln/data/content/dump.json`); `kiln lint` |
| Static caches, threads, timers or event handlers on non-Kiln objects | the old load context never unloads; `reload-test` reports leaks | keep state on the mod instance; stop what you start in `OnUnload` |
| `RegisterJson<T>()` with reflection for network messages | keeps an unloaded mod in memory after a hot reload for a while | source-generated `JsonTypeInfo<T>` or `INetMessage<T>` |
| `PlaySequence` of a cast to make an NPC or player cast a spell | the animation plays, the spell does not fire | `Abilities.Cast` / `RunImpact` for the effect |
| Expecting vanilla clients to see new items, icons or models | refused; with `modSync: off`, let in without new entities, and a Kiln item can crash them | state `clients` as `kiln` or `mod`; a server modpack delivers `mod` mods |
| Leaving `clients` unstated on a `both` mod that vanilla clients can't use | vanilla clients aren't refused: the default doesn't count | state `kiln` or `mod` |
| `"clients": "kiln"` for quests, clones or roster NPCs | the game's journal stays empty: the client builds them from the mod's files at boot | `"clients": "mod"`, `"side": "both"` (KL210) |
| Spawning a named NPC the world hasn't unlocked | the game destroys it within seconds | `place`, grant its unlock, or a `test_Townsfolk_*` villager |
| Reordering options, or renaming quests, steps or nodes, in native dialogue | ids change; saves drop what they held | keep names; add options at the end |
| A journal quest with no `name`, a step with no `text` or `title`, `roster` with no `clone` | KL312; that mod gets none of the game's UI, and its quests run with chat lines | fix what lint reports. Any `if` is fine: what one knowledge check can't say is about a second behind |
| Code-defined game-tree nodes on a dedicated server | not in the tree until the next start | `skills/*.json` |
| Comments or trailing commas in `assets/cook.json` | the cook fails (KL002, KL003) | plain JSON |
| A voice-over with an empty language slot | silence for players with that voice language | `"fallback": "en"`, if that's what you want |
| A Release build under the debugger | breakpoints never bind | deploy a Debug build |
| `kill -9` on netcoredbg while attached | the server dies with no save | disconnect from the editor |
| Raising max stacks, then removing the mod | after a restart without it, stacks above the vanilla size are cut on their next move | tell users; this is the game's own rule |
| Shipping cooked models, Impact listings or other game-derived files | redistributes game data | ship sources and a `cook.json` recipe; `assets/cooked/` is gitignored |
| Replacing a registered Impact program in place | refused: running instances read program code live | clone it to a new GUID |
| A Kiln impact without damage configs | it hits for 0 (no used item) | pass `Damage1` (e.g. `DamageSetup.FireOnly(10f)`) in the configs |
| An Impact loop without an exit | hangs the server's simulation step | the linter warns (`W_LOOP`): add an exit |
| Many hits on one target in one step | the engine applies at most 4 impacts per target per step | Kiln defers the rest; don't rely on them landing in the same step |
| Two mods detouring the same very hot function (advanced tier) | under Wine a hot reload of one can stall | one mod per hot function |
| Testing against the live server | players see your half-done mod; a fault disables it in front of them | a separate local test server |
| Claiming a client-side effect works after a server-only test | a dedicated server draws nothing, has no UI and no sound | list it as "needs a client check" |
